class Scanner:
    """Implementation of a nmap scanner and file exporter.

    This class is responsible for executing scans on any specified targets if possible, scanning for targets alive,
    ports, services, states and operating systems. It contains several pre-defined scan types and are gathered in
    the class variable SCAN_TYPES:
        TCP_CONNECT: For each target, execute a complete handshake between the two parts
        TCP_SYN: Sends a TCP-SYN and waits for a SYN-ACK as a response. Self responds with RST to close session.
        UDP: Sends an empty UDP Package for every port. An ICMP error will tell that port is closed, a "Destination
             unreachable" will tell that the ports is filtered. An UDP package will confirm that the port is open.
        FULL_UDP_TCP: Full TCP connection + UDP scan (TCP_CONNECT + UDP)
        FAST_UDP_TCP: TCP-SYN connection + UDP scan (TCP_SYN + UDP)
        SERVICES: Scan for service versions.
        NO_PING_SERVICES: Scan for service versions even without response from ICMP Ping.

    As the scan of a hole network could be really long, this class parses the specified targets into individual IPs
    and scans them one at a time, just for the purpose of presenting the information gradually. Ports are also parsed,
    just to obtain a list of all requested ports and know which ports need to be printed as closed (in case the user
    selects to print the closed ports). When the scan finishes, it creates a CSV file and exports them to the selected
    output directory with the desired name.

    Targets for scan can be specified manually (-t <targets>, from application parameters) or from an input file
    (-i <input_file(.txt | .csv)>, from application parameters). If the user selects an input file, the application
    behaviour differs depending on the extension:
        - TXT file: Read a single IP from each line.
        - CSV file: Expected file from previous step on the overall procedural application. Read IPs from the first
        column and store the rest of useful information, appending it to the output CSV as additional columns.

    User can request a scan difference (--diff <csv_file>, from application parameters), it uses
    the ScanComparator class to implement the logic for comparing two different scans: The one selected when using the
    --diff option, and the scan that is being executed.

        :param scan_type: Scan string representing the options to use.
        :param ports: Target ports
        :param output_directory: Output directory path
        :param output_file: Output file name.
        :param closed_ports: If True, print closed ports, if not, do not show them
        :param skip_os: If True, skip OS scan and set to 'Unknown'
        :param diff_file: CSV file for scan comparison.
        :param persistent: If True, keep scanning until user stops execution.
        :param output_pdf: If True, creates a PDF file with gathered information.

        :type skip_os: bool
        :type diff_file: str
        :type persistent: bool
        :type output_pdf: bool

    Apart from class __init__ arguments, there are another attributes.
    Attributes:
        __previous_info: dict. Contains all the info gathered from the CSV input, if there is some.
        __add_preivous_info: bool. Flag attribute that is set to True if there was any information gathered
            from the input CSV (if there is one), False in any other case.
        __id: int. Current target ID, used to maintain ID even when __service_scan() ends.

    note::
        The purpose of this class is to scan hosts, so no IDS/IPS or firewall evasion is implemented, which
        translates in maximum speed on packed sending.
